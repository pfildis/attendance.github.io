									<h2>Our Team</h2>
									<p>As a group we are developing a web application that takes attendence in class by using computer
										vision and machine learning techniques. The teacher takes a photograph in the class with his/her mobile phone and upload it 
									to the our web site. Our deep learning model regocnizes persons that is in the photograph. <br>

							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>
							Welcome to our revolutionary attendance management project that leverages the power of AI and face recognition techniques to streamline
							the process of taking attendance in the classroom. With our innovative system, bid farewell to traditional methods and embrace a modern, 
							efficient, and accurate solution. At the heart of our project lies the implementation of a Siamese Network, specifically utilizing the 
							SENet50 architecture. This advanced neural network model with weights that specifically trained for face recognition tasks, allowing us to 
							achieve remarkable accuracy in identifying individuals. <br>
							<br>
							To begin, we start with the premise that each student has only one photograph available,
							obtained from our institutional BİLSİS system. Leveraging this unique aspect, we leverage the Siamese Network to create embedded layers for each
							person's photograph, enabling us to establish distinct facial signatures. <br>
							<br>
							Next, we employ the powerful YOLOV8 model as our face detector. This 
							state-of-the-art algorithm excels at detecting and localizing faces within class photographs, providing us with the crucial initial step in 
							our attendance-taking process. By extracting these detected faces, we gain a focused and refined dataset to work with. The real magic happens
							when we combine the embedded layers generated by the Siamese Network with the extracted faces from the YOLOV8 model. By comparing the embedded 
							layers of individuals in our database with the embedded layers of the detected faces using the cosine distance method, we can confidently determine 
							the identity of each individual in the class photographs. These techniques and algorithms ensures a robust and accurate
							attendance-taking system.
